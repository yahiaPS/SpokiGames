You&#8217;re being chased by more than just one car now &#8211; there are two coming from each side.

This game is designed with moderate gaming mechanics. The sole goal here is to save yourself from getting caught by the Police!    So speed up your car as fast as you can, but you have to keep an eye on the direction of travel as well. The Police are clever; they change the way they are chasing you!    Don&#8217;t just wait now.

You need to use all of your skills in Car Stunt Race: driving fast enough to outrun them or cleverly weaving between their cars while still being careful not to crash into anyone else on the road; sometimes even jumping over a few police vehicles without slowing down is necessary for victory.

The relief from knowing that no matter how many times you&#8217;ve escaped capture before, it wasn&#8217;t going to happen again today because there was just too big a gap between my last encounter with those pesky cops.    The Police are chasing you; better not let them get away quickly; otherwise, they might start taking more daring measures, which could end up hurting both parties involved.    Run for your life!
