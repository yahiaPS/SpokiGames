Tap Tap Color Ants is a very simple simulation game in which you help the ants get their food by tapping on the screen. It would help if you tapped on each ant to determine their destination.    Once done, they will all start walking and eventually find the food or be unfortunate enough to fall into an abyss.

Make sure not to use too many taps unnecessarily as it is possible for them to starve without any food!    Tap Tap Ants is a game that puts you in charge of the ants. You can tap to make them walk or shake your device for some creative ant-antics!     Your favorite bugs need your help making friends with each other and collecting color coins, so they know who&#8217;s on their team, but watch out because it&#8217;s not always easy being green around these parts!    Tap Tap Color Ants is a very unique and interactive game about ants. You can get to know the life of an ant colony, how they live together, what type of food they eat and what their enemies are! When you tap on one color, all the ants from that color will start moving randomly around the screen.     The goal is to guide them back into their nest so that some new eggs can be laid there.  The ants have three colors in this game &#8211; orange, green, and red. If you tap on any of these colors, it will change the whole group&#8217;s color to that respective color before starting again with random movements.

The ants are coming towards the shelter and need your help to reach them. Unfortunately, you only have so much time for each level before they stop making their way over there because of too many obstacles in the ant&#8217;s path.     It&#8217;s easy- but not that easy since you can get more points by matching both colors at once with one tap or keep getting combos every few seconds as long as it matches up correctly!  So don&#8217;t let those cute little insects down now when they&#8217;re on their last leg across this dangerous journey!
